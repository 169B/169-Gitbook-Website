# Part Ordering

### Overview

Use this page to request parts for Team 169. Before submitting an order, confirm that the part is legal for competition and that you have all the details you need (vendor, part number, link, quantity).

Always verify the part details on the vendor’s website before submitting the **Part Order Request Form**. This helps prevent incorrect or incomplete orders.
