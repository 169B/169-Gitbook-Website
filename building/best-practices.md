## 🔧 Best Practices

_Goal: robust yet lightweight._

There are many ways to build in VEX, but the best robots are both **strong** and **lightweight**. The goal is to survive multiple competitions without breaking while staying as light as possible for speed and agility.

### Triangle bracing

Triangle bracing uses standoffs at angles to brace higher points on the robot. This greatly improves the stability of tall structures such as towers, lifts, or intakes.

* Connect high points back down to the chassis using standoffs.
* Form **triangles**, not squares – triangles don’t deform easily under load.
* Use multiple braces spaced apart rather than a single brace in one spot.

For this type of bracing, a common technique is to use **shaft collars screwed into each other and into standoffs**, so that you can adjust angles and keep everything tight.

### Lighter is better

Lighter robots accelerate faster, turn more easily, and usually outscore heavy robots.

Ways to save weight:

* Use **thin nylock nuts** where possible – they are about 50% lighter, and the savings add up across hundreds of fasteners.
* Use **aluminum** instead of steel for structural pieces. Steel is stronger, but also much heavier; in most VEX applications, aluminum is strong enough and far better for performance.

Be intentional about every gram on the robot – especially above the drivetrain, where weight directly affects tipping and acceleration.

### Center of gravity

Ideally, your robot’s center of gravity (CoG) should be:

* **Low** – reduces the chance of tipping over.
* **Centered** (front–back and left–right) – makes autonomous routines more consistent and driving more predictable.

Practical tips:

* Keep heavy components (motors, battery, air tanks, steel parts) as low as possible.
* Try to balance weight left–right. For example, mount the brain/battery on one side and air tanks or other heavy components on the opposite side.
* Avoid stacking lots of weight high above the drivetrain unless absolutely necessary.

### Zip ties!

Zip ties are the **duct tape of VEX Robotics**. They are great in some scenarios, but not all.

Good uses:

* Attaching bearing flats on the drivetrain (they see very little lateral stress).
* Light‑duty cable management and keeping wires tidy.
* Temporary fixes or prototyping.

Advantages:

* Faster to install than screws and nuts.
* Lighter – for example, using zip ties instead of screws on bearing flats can save noticeable weight across the whole robot.

However, **zip ties should not be used for high‑stress or pivotal structural connections**. Under repeated load, they can stretch, loosen, or snap. For joints that carry torque or impact (gears, drive shafts, major braces), use proper screws, nuts, and metal bracing.
