# Motors

## Motors

Motors are the power source for almost everything your robot does: driving, intakes, lifts, and other mechanisms.

This page is a high‑level starting point; expand it over time with your team’s preferred gearing, ratios, and examples.

### Key concepts

* **Torque vs. speed:** Higher torque is better for heavy loads; higher speed is better for fast movement. Gear your mechanisms based on what they need to do.
* **Motor limits:** Be aware of your competition’s motor count and port limits, and plan how many motors you can dedicate to the drivetrain vs. mechanisms.
* **Thermal throttling:** Overloaded motors will overheat and slow down. Use reasonable gear ratios and avoid constant stalling.

### Good practices

* Use **identical gearing** on both sides of a drivetrain so the robot drives straight.
* Avoid stacking too many gears on a single shaft; this increases friction.
* Support long shafts with bearing flats on both sides to reduce bending and binding.
* Label or document which motor ports are used for which subsystems for easier debugging.

Over time, you can add example gear ratios, sample calculations, and photos/CAD of good motor mounting.
