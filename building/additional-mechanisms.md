# Additional Mechanisms

## Additional Mechanisms

This section is for mechanisms beyond the drivetrain that score points and interact with game elements: intakes, lifts, claws, wings, blockers, and more.

Use this page as an overview and link out to more detailed mechanism‑specific pages as you create them.

### Examples of additional mechanisms

* **Intakes** – Rollers, claws, conveyors, or other systems that collect game objects.
* **Lifts** – 4‑bar, 6‑bar, DR4B, or other linkages used to raise game elements.
* **Deployables** – Wings, anti‑tips, or blockers that fold out during the match.
* **Endgame mechanisms** – Any game‑specific scoring tools used at the end of a match.

### General design advice

* Start from your **game analysis**: what tasks matter most, and what mechanisms are top teams using?
* CAD mechanisms early so you can check clearances and mounting to the drivetrain.
* Keep designs as simple as possible while still meeting performance goals.
* Prototype quickly with temporary mounts before committing to a full, rigid structure.

As your team builds successful robots, add photos, CAD links, and breakdowns of specific mechanisms here.
