# C++ Programming Intro

### :horse:     **Welcome!**

Welcome to the programming side of Haverford Robotics Team 169.

This page gives you a simple overview of:

* What robot programmers do
* The tools we use
* How to read the rest of this coding documentation

***

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are new to coding, read each page in order and press **"next"** at the end of every page.

We will explain any new words and show you how to do the basics in **C++**.
{% endhint %}

### **What We Do as Programmers**

As a programmer, your job is to make the robot follow the driver’s commands and run on its own when needed.

We mainly work on:

1. **Drivetrain control**
   * Make the robot move forward, backward, and turn
   * Use sensors (like encoders and the IMU) to make movement accurate
2. **Autonomous code**
   * Write C++ code that runs the robot by itself during the 15-second autonomous period
   * Plan and code simple routines that score points without driver control
3. **Subsystems**
   * Program parts like arms, lifts, and intakes
   * Make sure all parts can run together and are easy for the driver to use
4. **Sensor feedback**
   * Read data from distance, color, and rotation sensors
   * Use that data to adjust the robot’s actions in real time

***

### **Tools We Use**

We mainly use:

* **VEXcode V5 (C++)** – Our main tool and language for writing robot code
* **VS Code** – A code editor we sometimes use to work with larger projects

You will start in **VEXcode V5 with C++**. Other tools will come later.

### **How to Use This Documentation!**

* Some words have **dotted underlines**. **Click them** to see a short definition.
  * Example: [like this.](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]
* Hint blocks show important notes or warnings. For example:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Always read these blocks. They often explain common mistakes or key rules.
{% endhint %}

* Some pages will have **videos** or **interactive tutorials** to show you how to use VS Code, VEXcode, and other tools.
