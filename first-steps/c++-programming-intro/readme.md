# Getting Setup with VSCode and PROS

C++ is the primary programming language used for VEX V5 robotics.

{% hint style="info" %}
You do not have to know how to code in C++. There are simple instructions on how to do most needed and basic functions.
{% endhint %}

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a lightweight, flexible, and widely-used code editor that supports C++ development and VEX projects. Using VSCode for VEX Robotics allows programmers to edit, manage and use this code you will learn.

**PROS is an add-on to VSCode that allows your code to "talk" with your robot and actually function.**



{% stepper %}
{% step %}
## Download VSCode

<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" class="button primary" data-icon="square-down">VSCode Download</a>

{% hint style="info" %}
This will download an app on your computer that can show, run and edit code. Move on to the next step to learn how to set it up for VEX Robotics coding.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Install Pros and C++

Once you have fully downloaded VSCode a window should pop up.

{% hint style="info" %}
Press to get started and follow the interactive tutorial with your own VSCode.



Press the blue flashing buttons to move on to the next step.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Download A Template

There are many templates in the VEX V5 Community. They are existing "templates" of code that most people use for reliable and tested functions.

**We HIGHLY recommend that you use EZ-Template especially for new Programmers and if you are new to the C++ langauge.**

{% hint style="info" %}
Press open on the left to go to the Template.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
{% embed url="https://ez-robotics.github.io/EZ-Template/tutorials/installation" %}

Scroll down and go to:&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 10.14.39 pm.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Save it to your Downloads or similar.



<a href="../../docs-pages/programming-templates.md" class="button secondary">Other Templates to Use</a>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Extract the downloaded Template:

Windows Users: ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)



Apple Mac Users:       ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Open the folder in VSCode after your computer extracted the ".ZIP" file:



<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-11-19 at 11.42.28 pm.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Select the folder that you extracted from the ZIP file.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is usually called "EZ-Template-Example-Project" if you downloaded the EZ-Template file.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

#### Great Work! :tada::tada:

Your VSCode and VEX template are all fully ready to use and configure.

Let's move on to configuring your robot in the code.



**As usual, press the right "next" button to carry on.**
